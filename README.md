All current project repositories are private, so some coding examples are provided here.  

- [mouse_model](https://github.com/lz100/showcase/blob/master/mouse_model.Rmd) is some R data analysis for mouse behavior training in neuroscience. The output results can be viewed [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lz100/showcase/blob/master/mouse_model.html).

- [multiprocess_wrapper](https://github.com/lz100/showcase/blob/master/multiprocess_wrapper.py)
and [universal_functions](https://github.com/lz100/showcase/blob/master/universal_functions.py) are some python general utilities like parallel computing, logging, *etc*. that can be used in all projects. 

- [Variant_summary](https://github.com/lz100/showcase/blob/master/One_sample_WGS_report.pdf) is a simple variant statistic analysis.
